Ideas for:
    Signal Extended Observer
    * Can I hide the "countdown" property?  Or make it truly a private property of the block?

    Glaze Container
    * Need to get the emulated block stuff working better
        * What tool breaks the block
        * Rendering (may drop what I'm trying to copy from other mods/@error and use @TheGreyGhost's MBE04 example)
            * Will any changes in that cause issues with what I'm otherwise trying to do?
        * Can you do "string" properties in Minecraft?  So I can have it say which block it contains (for debug)?
            * I don't believe so, since Forge says "all combinations of properties are generated on startup" so a string would be overkill

    Directed Redstone Wiring / Redstone Rod
    * Like an end rod
        * Since 1.16.2 changed chains to be placable like end rods without light... can just fall back to "like an end rod"
        * That would mean I don't have to worry about branching or linking to redstone
            * Though if I were to "do it like a chain" that could mean allowing these to be waterlogged
            * Need to check the pre release, do chains break when hit by flowing water?
    * It is powered by/powering blocks they are attached to
        * Don't receive or give off power any other way
        * They are one way only (like a repeater, power in one side, power out the other)
            * That means, if you want "two way" powering, you'll need two lines (one going each way)
    * Works like redstone dust and has signal drop-off
        * Do I then need to consider a "vertical redstone repeater" to help with this?
            * No, the expectation will be to feed the rods into a block to power it, then continue the rods (which'll pick back up at 15 power)
        
    * Recipe?
        * If it is like an end rod... could just do the end rod recipe but add in redstone dust?
            * Blaze Rod + Popped Chorus Fruit + Redstone Dust
                * 1 Dust for 4 Redstone Rods?  Or 4 Dust for 4 Redstone Rods?
            * End Rod + Redstone Dust
        * Or should I give an option that is easier to get early on?
            * 3 Redstone Dust in a line
        * Why not both?  But make the version using end rod components give more than just using redstone dust

    Configurable Pistons
    * Will have an interface when interacted with, like a chest or furnace
    * On one side, you can put in (up to 4? or more?) sticks/pistons/whatever to specify how far the piston extends
    * On the other, you can put in up to the same number of slime balls/slime blocks to specify how many blocks in a line it can pull
    * The piston face will either need a specific graphic to support both or I'll have to see if you can override the model or a texture
        * If no slime, use the regular piston face, if slime, use the sticky piston face
    * Don't know if I can "fix" it so redstone dust doesn't break when the piston state changes and the dust is on any side except the front
        * Meaning, the dust is going along the side or back, obviously it should break if it's on the side that pushes
    * Recipe?
        * Should it be as "cheap" as a normal piston or have some other cost in place of the redstone dust or iron ingot?
