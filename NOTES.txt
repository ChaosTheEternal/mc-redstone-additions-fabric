Ideas for:
    Signal Extended Observer
    * Can I hide the "countdown" property?  Or make it truly a private property of the block?

    Glossy Blocks
    * I think, in the GlossyBlocks code file, I have all the blocks considered that I'll be doing
    * Unless some of the blocks I have listed have facing, everything should be able to be handled in the single file
    * Considerations
        * In general, these are expected to be used where you would be using slime/honey blocks to move multiple blocks, so minimal visiblity
        * Cobblestone and variants
            * For: it's a standard block that everyone has, variants are for appearance
            * Against: it's supposed to simulate cobbled together stone, which would be harder to "glaze" like this
        * Sand and Gravel (or other gravity afflicted blocks)
            * Against: stock gravity blocks I don't believe can be pulled anyways
        * Dirt and Grass
            * Against: same consideration as cobblestone (glazing dirt particles?)
        * Clay and Terracotta
            * Against: Terracotta becomes glazed terracotta, clay is kinda like cobblestone (and becomes brick, which I would include)
        * Stone/Smooth Stone/Stone Brick/Bricks
            * For: it's a cleaner building block
            * Against: ... nothing, really
        * Diorite, Andesite, Granite (and smooth versions)
            * For: alternatives of stone, really
            * Against: consideration of the regular versions like cobble (though don't appear like it), otherwise these are fine
        * Aquatic Blocks, Nether Blocks, End Blocks
            * For: many unrefined are cleaner, refined are obvious
            * Against: no reason except for maybe unrefined versions (netherrack, soul soil, end rock, etc.)
        * Also, would likely need to make furnace recipes to convert the glazed versions back to regular (burning off the glaze)

    Directed Redstone Wiring / Redstone Rod
    * Like an end rod
        * Since 1.16.2 changed chains to be placable like end rods without light... can just fall back to "like an end rod"
        * That would mean I don't have to worry about branching or linking to redstone
            * Though if I were to "do it like a chain" that could mean allowing these to be waterlogged
            * Need to check the pre release, do chains break when hit by flowing water?
    * It is powered by/powering blocks they are attached to
        * Don't receive or give off power any other way
        * They are one way only (like a repeater, power in one side, power out the other)
            * That means, if you want "two way" powering, you'll need two lines (one going each way)
    * Works like redstone dust and has signal drop-off
        * Do I then need to consider a "vertical redstone repeater" to help with this?
            * No, the expectation will be to feed the rods into a block to power it, then continue the rods (which'll pick back up at 15 power)        
    * Recipe?
        * If it is like an end rod... could just do the end rod recipe but add in redstone dust?
            * Blaze Rod + Popped Chorus Fruit + Redstone Dust
                * 1 Dust for 4 Redstone Rods?  Or 4 Dust for 4 Redstone Rods?
            * End Rod + Redstone Dust
        * Or should I give an option that is easier to get early on?
            * 3 Redstone Dust in a line
        * Why not both?  But make the version using end rod components give more than just using redstone dust

    Configurable Pistons
    * First thing to figure out, can I even modify the piston retraction logic to pull more than the attached block (if piston is sticky)
        * If I can't, then the only option for this is just "extended" pistons, which did already exist (but doesn't appear to have been updated in a long while)
        * It doesn't look at first glance that I couldn't, but it definitely doesn't look that simple
    * Will have an interface when interacted with, like a chest or furnace
    * On one side, you can put in (up to 4? or more?) sticks/pistons/whatever to specify how far the piston extends
    * On the other, you can put in up to the same number of slime balls/slime blocks to specify how many blocks in a line it can pull
    * The piston face will either need a specific graphic to support both or I'll have to see if you can override the model or a texture
        * If no slime, use the regular piston face, if slime, use the sticky piston face
    * Don't know if I can "fix" it so redstone dust doesn't break when the piston state changes and the dust is on any side except the front
        * Meaning, the dust is going along the side or back, obviously it should break if it's on the side that pushes
    * Recipe?
        * Should it be as "cheap" as a normal piston or have some other cost in place of the redstone dust or iron ingot?
