Ideas for:
    Signal Extended Observer
    * Can I hide the "countdown" property?  Or make it truly a private property of the block?
    * The other option was to see if it's possible to cancel a scheduled tick, but it doesn't look like you can

    Configurable Pistons
    * First thing to figure out, can I even modify the piston retraction logic to pull more than the attached block (if piston is sticky)
        * If I can't, then the only option for this is just "extended" pistons, which did already exist (but doesn't appear to have been updated in a long while)
        * It doesn't look at first glance that I couldn't, but it definitely doesn't look that simple
    * Will have an interface when interacted with, like a chest or furnace
        * Problem with this is, I already was having issues with an "inventory" system with the glaze container, and that was only taking a single block
        * This one I'd intended to have it figure out what to update the state to when the inventory changes
        * Also, would have to make it so the inventory isn't accessible while extended (and closes if it's being accessed and it extends)
            * If I can't get an inventory system to work, then I'd just need different versions (e.g. 2 Block Piston, 2 Block Sticky Piston, 3 Block Piston, etc.)
            * Since 1.16 fixed zero-ticking, I hopefully wouldn't have a problem with that (though should the extend/retract be just as fast?)
                * Making it slower means the same problem the SEO has (a visible "countdown" property), but that definitely kills zero-ticking
                * But that may also break some other conditions
                    * But the point of this piston (at least, the sticky version) is to avoid the setups that require chaining sticky pistons
    * On one side, you can put in (up to 4? or more?) sticks/pistons/whatever to specify how far the piston extends
    * On the other, you can put in up to the same number of slime balls/slime blocks to specify how many blocks in a line it can pull
    * The piston face will either need a specific graphic to support both or I'll have to see if you can override the model or a texture
        * If no slime, use the regular piston face, if slime, use the sticky piston face
    * Obviously, the "pull X blocks" sticky version will only pull blocks until:
        * It hits an air block
        * It hits a block that can't be pulled
        * It is pulling X blocks
    * Don't know if I can "fix" it so redstone dust doesn't break when the piston state changes and the dust is on any side except the front
        * Meaning, the dust is going along the side or back, obviously it should break if it's on the side that pushes
    * Recipe?
        * Should it be as "cheap" as a normal piston or have some other cost in place of the redstone dust or iron ingot?

    Anything else?
    * On/Off Buttons
        * Look like buttons (except maybe some redstone indicator that does tinting) but work like levers
        * Keep the press delay of each type of button (wood and stone) but each click toggles the state instead of sends a pulse while the button is depressed
        * Recipe?
            * Regular button recipe with redstone dust on each side
            * Maybe multiple recipes (one using the block, one using the button)
        * Just realized, including the wood options means 8 wooden buttons being made
            * Also looks like I'd have to change quite a bit, since the button has a POWERED property which is used to determine how it appears
            * I either make a PRESSED property that works like POWERED for display purposes (the "right" way)
            * Or I make a POWERING property that toggles when pressed and that determines power output, while POWERED is still used to determine appearance (the "easy" way)
    * Player-only Pressure Plates
        * Basically the name, a pressure plate variant that only detects Players and nothing else
            * No dropped items, no passive mobs, no hostile mobs
            * Why not variants for each of those as well?  A passive mob pressure plate, a hostile mob pressure plate, and an entity pressure plate?
                * May have to change assumptions for what is passive and what is hostile
                * Llamas are generally passive except against wolves, but would want to consider them passive
                * Zombie Piglins are passive unless provoked, but would probably work on the "hostile mobs" plate
                * Iron Golems are passive or neutral depending on how they spawned
            * Maybe stick with the "Player-only" one first
        * Obviously need a better name
        * Recipe?
            * I guess the question is, which pressure plate should this mimic?
            * Stone (and Blackstone, I guess) is the closest
