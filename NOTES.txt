Ideas for:
    Signal Extended Observer
    * Can I hide the "countdown" property?  Or make it truly a private property of the block?

    Glaze Container
    * Need to get the emulated block stuff working, if possible
        * What tool breaks the block, what light level the block is, what blast resistance and hardness it has
            * This might not be possible on the Fabric side, so I may need to reconsider going the route of "breaking it places the contained block and drops the container"
        * If/When I get light level stuff working, will this have the same issue I was having with Forge where it wouldn't tell the client to update world lighting?
            * That might've been me, though, needing to call some method to tell it "hey, lighting changed" and I just wasn't
    * Other option is, scrap the container logic and just make "Glazed XXX" where XXX is the block
        * Only thinking of including solid, non-gravity afflicted blocks, e.g.
            * Cobblestone and variants, Stone, Smooth Stone, Stone Brick (and variants)
            * Brick
            * Diorite, Andesite, Granite (and smooth versions)
            * Sea Lantern and other aquatic blocks
            * Nether related blocks, End related blocks, etc.
        * Problem of that route is, there are a *lot* of blocks to consider or add, and may need reasons to exclude
    * Considerations
        * In general, these are expected to be used where you would be using slime/honey blocks to move multiple blocks, so minimal visiblity
        * Cobblestone and variants
            * For: it's a standard block that everyone has, variants are for appearance
            * Against: it's supposed to simulate cobbled together stone, which would be harder to "glaze" like this
        * Sand and Gravel (or other gravity afflicted blocks)
            * Against: stock gravity blocks I don't believe can be pulled anyways
        * Dirt and Grass
            * Against: same consideration as cobblestone (glazing dirt particles?)
        * Clay and Terracotta
            * Against: Terracotta becomes glazed terracotta, clay is kinda like cobblestone (and becomes brick, which I would include)
        * Stone/Smooth Stone/Stone Brick/Bricks
            * For: it's a cleaner building block
            * Against: ... nothing, really
        * Diorite, Andesite, Granite (and smooth versions)
            * For: alternatives of stone, really
            * Against: consideration of the regular versions like cobble (though don't appear like it), otherwise these are fine
        * Aquatic Blocks, Nether Blocks, End Blocks
            * For: many unrefined are cleaner, refined are obvious
            * Against: 

    Directed Redstone Wiring / Redstone Rod
    * Like an end rod
        * Since 1.16.2 changed chains to be placable like end rods without light... can just fall back to "like an end rod"
        * That would mean I don't have to worry about branching or linking to redstone
            * Though if I were to "do it like a chain" that could mean allowing these to be waterlogged
            * Need to check the pre release, do chains break when hit by flowing water?
    * It is powered by/powering blocks they are attached to
        * Don't receive or give off power any other way
        * They are one way only (like a repeater, power in one side, power out the other)
            * That means, if you want "two way" powering, you'll need two lines (one going each way)
    * Works like redstone dust and has signal drop-off
        * Do I then need to consider a "vertical redstone repeater" to help with this?
            * No, the expectation will be to feed the rods into a block to power it, then continue the rods (which'll pick back up at 15 power)        
    * Recipe?
        * If it is like an end rod... could just do the end rod recipe but add in redstone dust?
            * Blaze Rod + Popped Chorus Fruit + Redstone Dust
                * 1 Dust for 4 Redstone Rods?  Or 4 Dust for 4 Redstone Rods?
            * End Rod + Redstone Dust
        * Or should I give an option that is easier to get early on?
            * 3 Redstone Dust in a line
        * Why not both?  But make the version using end rod components give more than just using redstone dust

    Configurable Pistons
    * Will have an interface when interacted with, like a chest or furnace
    * On one side, you can put in (up to 4? or more?) sticks/pistons/whatever to specify how far the piston extends
    * On the other, you can put in up to the same number of slime balls/slime blocks to specify how many blocks in a line it can pull
    * The piston face will either need a specific graphic to support both or I'll have to see if you can override the model or a texture
        * If no slime, use the regular piston face, if slime, use the sticky piston face
    * Don't know if I can "fix" it so redstone dust doesn't break when the piston state changes and the dust is on any side except the front
        * Meaning, the dust is going along the side or back, obviously it should break if it's on the side that pushes
    * Recipe?
        * Should it be as "cheap" as a normal piston or have some other cost in place of the redstone dust or iron ingot?
