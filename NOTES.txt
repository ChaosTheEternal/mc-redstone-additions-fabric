Ideas for:
    Signal Extended Observer
    * Can I hide the "countdown" property?  Or make it truly a private property of the block?
    * The other option was to see if it's possible to cancel a scheduled tick, but it doesn't look like you can

    Configurable Pistons
    * First thing to figure out, can I even modify the piston retraction logic to pull more than the attached block (if piston is sticky)
        * If I can't, then the only option for this is just "extended" pistons, which did already exist (but doesn't appear to have been updated in a long while)
        * It doesn't look at first glance that I couldn't, but it definitely doesn't look that simple
    * Will have an interface when interacted with, like a chest or furnace
    * On one side, you can put in (up to 4? or more?) sticks/pistons/whatever to specify how far the piston extends
    * On the other, you can put in up to the same number of slime balls/slime blocks to specify how many blocks in a line it can pull
    * The piston face will either need a specific graphic to support both or I'll have to see if you can override the model or a texture
        * If no slime, use the regular piston face, if slime, use the sticky piston face
    * Don't know if I can "fix" it so redstone dust doesn't break when the piston state changes and the dust is on any side except the front
        * Meaning, the dust is going along the side or back, obviously it should break if it's on the side that pushes
    * Recipe?
        * Should it be as "cheap" as a normal piston or have some other cost in place of the redstone dust or iron ingot?

    Anything else?
    * On/Off Buttons
        * Look like buttons (except maybe some redstone indicator that does tinting) but work like levers
        * Keep the press delay of each type of button (wood and stone) but each click toggles the state instead of sends a pulse while the button is depressed
    * Player-only Pressure Plates
        * Basically the name, a pressure plate variant that only detects Players and nothing else
            * No dropped items, no passive mobs, no hostile mobs
            * Why not variants for each of those as well?  A passive mob pressure plate, a hostile mob pressure plate, and an entity pressure plate?
                * May have to change assumptions for what is passive and what is hostile
                * Llamas are generally passive except against wolves, but would want to consider them passive
                * Zombie Piglins are passive unless provoked, but would probably work on the "hostile mobs" plate
                * Iron Golems are passive or neutral depending on how they spawned
            * Maybe stick with the "Player-only" one first
